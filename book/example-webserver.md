# Running a Webserver

Building upon the Hello World! example, let's run a web server from Solo that is able to display realtime telemetry to any web browser running on a device connected to Solo's network.

This can provide an alternate interface to Solo internals than just the Solo app. For example, you can create a ground control station written entirely in JavaScript and HTML, or allow a control panel for custom (or even fully autonomous) actions by Solo!
