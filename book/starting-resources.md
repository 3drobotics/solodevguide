This guide presents enough information for getting started developing on Solo. Various libraries and tools are used in this book that incorporate more information elsewhere.

* _**[DroneKit](http://dronekit.io/)**_ &mdash; A toolkit that can be used to monitor and control a connected vehicle. *DroneKit* has libraries for Android, Python, and iOS. Solo uses *DroneKit* internally to develop Smart Shots, which convert simple user commands into intelligent cinematic flight modes.
