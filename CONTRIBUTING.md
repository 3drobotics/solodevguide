Hi! Thanks for your interest in contributing to #solodevguide

If you would like to add new content, please consider these guidelines:

1. If you think your addition is a core part of the development experience, please add content to README.md. (This is easiest for us to consider and edit.)
1. If you have a long tutorial that is not part of the core development experience (let's say, a comprehensive guide on how to tune MAVProxy for running in an embedded platform) a separate `.md` file in the repository is fine.

<aside class="note">
Do not edit the Table of Contents, it is auto-generated. Add linked items under a separate `##` header in README.md and link to the content in a short sentence.
</aside>

Most importantly, don't overthink where your content should go. We're still in the development phase and we will steward all new contributions to where they should be.

Ping @tcr3dr on an issue with any questions.
